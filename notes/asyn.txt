synchronous 
(What is difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?
While synchronous processing is done sequentially and in a specific order,
asynchronous processing is done in parallel. Tasks that are not dependent on others can be offloaded and
executed at the same time as the main operation and then report back the result when they are done.)

Single Threaded
(the execution of an entire task from beginning to end without interruption)
