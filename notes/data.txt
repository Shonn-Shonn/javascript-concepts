Data Structures And Algorithms


Data Structures = different ways of storing data on your computer

Algorithms = operations on different data Structures

..sets of instructions for execution them


Shells 

JavaScript shell that is part of
Mozillaâ€™s comprehensive JavaScript environment known as SpiderMonkey

A JavaScript shell allows you to quickly test snippets of JavaScript code without having to reload a web page. They are extremely useful for developing and debugging code.

-------------------------
Arrays and Lists: the most common data structures

Classic data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and graphs

Classic algorithms for sorting and searching data.

WHY STUDY DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS 

Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs(Prentice-Hall)

letvsvar 

let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement

LET -> declares a block-scoped local variable 

Unlike var..let does not create a property of the global object

ECMAScript is  a JavaScript standard


VARIABLE HOSTING -> variable lifting 


DATA TYPES
Statically Typed Language / Loosely Typed Language
